	<h2>Summary</h2>
	<p>This course will provide a conceptual and practical
		understanding of how to leverage technologies in a range of common
		activities such as searching, social networking, presenting, and
		creating web content. The emphasis will be on using and understanding
		digital technologies in effective and ethical ways in our digital
		society. This is an undergraduate course that is a mix of lecture,
		discussion, tutorial and workshop.</p>
	<p>
		This instance of the course (Winter 2013) will focus on <a
			href="http://processing.org/">Processing</a>, an open-source
		programming language and development environment that is especially
		well-suited to creating interactive visual art and data
		visualizations. Considerable time and effort will be devoted to
		learning how to code. You need not have any technical background or
		programming experience, but you do need to be thoroughly committed to
		learning new skills that will require abundant perseverance and
		resourcefulness. The most important skills you will learn are not
		coding competencies, they're problem-solving competencies: how to
		figure out how to do what you don't know how to do in the process of
		creating digital works.
	</p>
	<p>Despite the focus on Processing, this is not a programming
		course, it is a course about effective communication in a digital
		society. We are motivated by a desire to combine the traditional
		strengths of the humanities – critical thinking, effective expression,
		historical and cultural perspectives, nuanced and imaginative
		approaches, etc. –  with technical skills that will allow us to become
		creators of compelling digital content, going beyond more
		conventional academic forms of expression (like the essay).</p>
	<h2>Learning Outcomes</h2>
	<p>By the end of this course students should be able to</p>
	<ul>
		<li>critically assess data visualizations (from news sources,
			blogs, advertising, etc.)</li>
		<li>acquire, parse, filter and mine data</li>
		<li>create and refine interactive data visualizations (in
			Processing)</li>
		<li>develop effective strategies for learning new visualization
			techniques and solving problems</li>
		<li>plan and implement a collaborative digital project</li>
		<li>better understand and discuss the significance of data and
			data visualizations in our digital society</li>
	</ul>

	<h2>Course Materials</h2>
	<p>
		There is one required text: Ben Fry's <em>Visualizing Data</em>, which
		can be acquired in <a
			href="http://shop.oreilly.com/product/9780596514556.do">print
			and/or electronic formats from the publisher</a>, or from other
		bookstores (the electronic files from the publisher are the most
		flexible (DRM-free), though there are <a
			href="http://www.amazon.ca/Visualizing-Data-Explaining-Environment-ebook/dp/B0028N4WJC/">cheaper
			editions available</a>). This text is outstanding at describing processes
		for working on data visualizations, including several compelling
		examples that show useful techniques and concepts. However, the text
		isn't the most effective at teaching the fundamentals of the
		Processing language, but I will fill in gaps during class. As a
		further supplement, students may also want to consider purchasing the
		very economical <em>Getting Started with Processing</em> by Casey Reas
		&amp; Ben Fry, again <a
			href="http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920000570.do">available
			from the publisher</a> and <a
			href="http://www.amazon.ca/gp/product/144937980X">elsewhere</a> in
		print and electronic formats. Additional article-length readings will
		be assigned and made available through the course website.

	<h2>Policies</h2>

	<ul>
		<li>This course is a mix of theory and practice – students are
			expected to attend and participate thoughtfully and respectfully in
			the meetings. Students must bring a laptop to class to participate in
			the hands-on components.</li>
		<li>The Course Management System will be used extensively in this
			class to post notes, important date changes, assignment descriptions,
			etc. You are responsible for checking the site regularly (at least
			twice a week) for any changes or updates.</li>
		<li>In accord with McGill University's Charter of Students'
			Rights, you may submit in English or in French any written work that
			is to be graded. Please be aware that impeccable grammar is required
			whether you choose to write in French or in English.</li>
		<li>McGill University values academic integrity. Therefore all
			students must understand the meaning and consequences of cheating,
			plagiarism and other academic offences under the Code of Student
			Conduct and Disciplinary Procedures (see <a
			href="http://www.mcgill.ca/students/srr/honest/">www.mcgill.ca/students/srr/honest/</a>
			for more information). Please note that multimedia objects (images,
			video, etc.) as well as programming code are subject to the same
			standards of academic integrity.
