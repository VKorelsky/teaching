	<h2>Summary</h2>
	<p>Calendar Description: This course will provide a conceptual and practical
		understanding of how to leverage technologies in a range of common
		activities such as searching, social networking, presenting, and
		creating web content. The emphasis will be on using and understanding
		digital technologies in effective and ethical ways in our digital
		society. This is an undergraduate course that is a mix of lecture,
		discussion, tutorial and workshop.</p>
	<p>
		This instance of the course (Fall 2014) will focus on interactive, web-based
		visualization of information. Considerable time and effort will be devoted to
		learning how to code (HTML, CSS, Javascript…). You need not have any technical background or
		programming experience, but you do need to be thoroughly committed to
		learning new skills that will require abundant perseverance and
		resourcefulness. The most important skills you will learn are not
		coding competencies, they're problem-solving competencies: how to
		figure out how to do what you don't know how to do in the process of
		creating digital works.
	</p>
	<p>Despite the focus on web-based development, this is not a programming
		course, it is a course about effective communication in a digital
		society. We are motivated by a desire to combine the traditional
		strengths of the humanities – critical thinking, effective expression,
		historical and cultural perspectives, nuanced and imaginative
		approaches, etc. –  with technical skills that empower us to become
		creators of compelling digital content, going beyond more
		conventional academic forms of expression (like the essay).</p>
	<h2>Learning Outcomes</h2>
	<p>By the end of this course students should be able to</p>
	<ul>
		<li>critically assess data visualizations (from news sources,
			blogs, advertising, etc.)</li>
		<li>acquire, parse, filter and mine data</li>
		<li>create and refine interactive data visualizations</li>
		<li>develop effective strategies for learning new visualization
			techniques and solving problems</li>
		<li>plan and implement a collaborative digital project</li>
		<li>better understand and discuss the significance of data and
			data visualizations in our digital society</li>
	</ul>
