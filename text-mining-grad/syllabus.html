	<h2>Description</h2>
	<p>Digital texts are composed of discrete units of information that
		have the virtue of being infinitely malleable and reconfigurable,
		allowing new practices for searching, filtering, comparing,
		annotating, measuring, representing and understanding texts. From
		single works to virtual libraries, from canonical classics to
		contemporary social media, digital texts can provide rich fodder for
		interpretive practices in the digital humanities. This course will
		provide students with theoretical and practical foundations for
		working with a variety of digital texts.</p>
	<h2>Learning Outcomes</h2>
	<p>By the end of this course students should be able to</p>
	<ul>
		<li>compile and prepare for analysis a variety of types of
			digital texts</li>
		<li>use text analysis and statistical software to study digital
			texts</li>
		<li>produce visualizations from analytic and statistical data</li>
		<li>think algorithmically about digital texts</li>
		<li>navigate between close and distant reading practices</li>
		<li>describe and demonstrate the value and limitations of digital
			methodologies</li>
	</ul>
	<h2>Course Content</h2>
	<p>This is essentially a course on computer-assisted text analysis
		and text mining from humanistic perspectives. Considerable time and
		effort will be devoted to learning new digital methodologies. Students
		need not have any technical background, but students do need to be
		thoroughly committed to learning new skills that will require abundant
		perseverance and resourcefulness. The primary purposes of this course
		are to learn to think algorithmically about digital texts and to
		explore what interpretive and hermeneutic practices are enabled by
		digital methodologies (learning technical skill are a means to those
		ends). The course is organized into a set of modules whose duration
		will be determined by the students interests and needs:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>First Encounters with Digital Text &amp; Tools
			<ul>
				<li>what digital texts are out there?</li>
				<li>what digital tools are out there (Voyant Tools, Monk Project, Paper Machines, Wordseer, etc.)?</li>
				<li>what kinds of things are people doing with digital texts
					&amp; tools?</li>
				<li>what is a digital humanities approach to text analysis and
					text mining?</li>
			</ul>
		</li>
		<li>Close Reading and Microanalysis with R
			<ul>
				<li>loading a text</li>
				<li>generating and plotting frequencies</li>
				<li>graphing distribution</li>
				<li>correlating &amp; comparing data</li>
				<li>measuring vocabulary richness</li>
				<li>generating concordances</li>
				<li>working with XML</li>
			</ul>
		</li>
		<li>Preparing a Corpus
			<ul>
				<li>data sources &amp; formats</li>
				<li>web harvesting</li>
				<li>cleaning &amp; converting</li>
			</ul>
		</li>
		<li>Distant Reading and Macroanalysis with R and Mallet
			<ul>
				<li>loading a corpus</li>
				<li>loops and functions</li>
				<li>measuring distance between texts</li>
				<li>topic clustering</li>
			</ul>
		</li>
		<li>Text &amp; Data Representations
			<ul>
				<li>exporting, converting, and importing data</li>
				<li>visualization: spreadsheet applications, specialized
					applications, web-based solutions</li>
			</ul>
		</li>
	</ul>
	<h2>Instructional Method</h2>
	<p>This course is a graduate seminar that is a mix of discussion
		and hands-on workshop.</p>
	<h2>Course Materials</h2>
	<p>There are no materials to purchase for this course, all
		materials (weekly readings, tutorials, exercises, etc.) will be made
		available in digital format through the course website. The primary
		text that will be used is <em>Micro and Macro Analysis Using R</em>
		by Matthew Jockers (forthcoming) – this will be complemented by
		a selection of additional relevant articles. Students need
		to have a laptop computer with them during every class. Software
		packages include RStudio and Gephi.</p>
